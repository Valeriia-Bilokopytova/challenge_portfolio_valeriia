### Subtask 1: Why did I choose to participate in the Dare It Challenge?
Hello! My name is Valeriia. I'm from Ukraine. Because of war in my country, I was forced to leave my home and move to Poland. If my life is changes, I decided change my profession. 

In April 2022, I finished courses of Quality Assurance engineer and started looking for a job. The most vacancies require knowledge of test automation. So, I became interested in this topic and came across an ad for the challenge Dare IT.

I made a challenge for myself, and I want to test myself by participating in the Dare IT challenge. It is a good opportunity to improve my knowledge in IT, Soft Skills, English.

Thanks to the whole team and mentors of Dare IT for this opportunity.
